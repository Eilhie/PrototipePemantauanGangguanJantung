Sleep stress, often linked to poor-quality or insufficient sleep, is a condition in which stress disrupts normal sleep patterns, potentially leading to a cycle where stress causes sleep disturbances, and these disturbances, in turn, heighten stress levels.

Physiological Indicators
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV): Lower HRV is often associated with higher stress and less restorative sleep, as seen in those with obstructive sleep apnea or other sleep disorders.
- Heart Rate and Respiration Patterns: Irregularities in these patterns during sleep (such as from sleep apnea) are also correlated with increased physiological stress.
- Stress Hormones: Elevated cortisol levels, especially if they persist into the evening, are a sign of a stress response affecting sleep quality and can be measured as a marker of chronic sleep stress.


Studies are increasingly using ECG data, heart rate variability, and other biometrics to understand stress-sleep interactions. Machine learning models are being applied to datasets like the Apnea-ECG and MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database to classify stress levels during sleep and identify sleep-related health issues.

1. Preprocess the ECG Data
- Noise Reduction: Clean the ECG signal to remove artifacts and noise, using techniques like band-pass filtering.
- QRS Detection: Identify the QRS complex in each ECG beat, as it marks the heart rate intervals. Algorithms like the Pan-Tompkins algorithm can help detect QRS complexes reliably.
2. Feature Extraction for Stress Detection
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV): Calculate HRV from the detected R-R intervals (time between consecutive R peaks) in the ECG data. HRV is a useful feature in stress detection, as lower HRV often corresponds with higher stress levels.
    - Time-domain features (e.g., RMSSD, SDNN) can show short-term fluctuations in heart rate, which can be low in stress conditions.
    - Frequency-domain features (e.g., LF/HF ratio) are also useful, as high ratios often indicate stress.
- Heart Rate: Compute the average heart rate and variations throughout the sleep period. A higher heart rate and greater variability during sleep may be associated with higher stress.
3. Define Labeling Criteria for Stress
- Stress Labeling: Based on thresholds set from HRV and heart rate features, label each segment of the ECG as either "high stress" or "low stress." For example:
    - If HRV falls below a certain threshold and the heart rate is elevated, the segment could be labeled as "high stress."
    - If HRV and heart rate remain within a typical rest range, label the segment as "low stress."
- Apnea Events: In cases where sleep apnea is present, segments with frequent apnea events (identified in apnea-labeled datasets like Apnea-ECG) can also be marked as "high stress" due to associated oxygen desaturation and arousal responses.
4. Use Machine Learning for Stress Classification
- Split the data into labeled segments (e.g., 30-second windows) and use HRV features and other ECG-based metrics as inputs to a machine learning model (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, or deep learning models).
- Train the model to predict "high stress" or "low stress" labels based on these features, using part of the labeled data for training and part for testing.
